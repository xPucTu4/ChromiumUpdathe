# ChromiumUpdathe
Updater for chromium browser (official builds)

This will download and extract the latest build of chromium into your *Program Files* folder.  
If the folder exists, its content will be **deleted** and the downloaded version will be extracted there.  
Chromium uses folder named **chrome-win** in their archive.  
This name will be used for the folder inside your *Program Files*
